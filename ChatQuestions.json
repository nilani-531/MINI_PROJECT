    {
      "question": "What is a client-server architecture?",
      "answer": "Client-server architecture is a distributed computing model where a client requests resources or services from a server, which processes the request. The other options do not accurately define client-server architecture. Hence, the correct answer is 'Distributed model with clients requesting services from servers.'"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a microservice?",
      "answer": "A microservice is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, loosely coupled services, which can be developed and deployed independently. The other options do not accurately define a microservice. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Small, independent services in an application architecture.'"
